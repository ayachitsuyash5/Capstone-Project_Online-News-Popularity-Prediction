# Capstone-Project_Online-News-Popularity-Prediction
Capstone Project Synopsis Topic: Analysing Online News Popularity Data &amp; predicting the no. of shares using appropriate machine learning models.  Understanding the Business Case Study: In this information era, reading and sharing news have become the center of peopleâ€™s entertainment lives. Therefore, it would be greatly helpful if we could accurately predict the popularity of news prior to its publication, for social media workers (authors, advertisers, etc). For the purpose of this paper, we intend to make use of a largely and recently collected dataset with over 39000 articles from Mashable website, to first select informative features and then analyze and compare the performance of several machine learning algorithms. The dataset is provided by UCI machine learning repository, originally acquired and preprocessed by K.Fernandes et al. It extracts 60 attributes (as numerical values) describing different aspects of each article, from a total of 39644 articles published in the last two years from Mashable website
